# my-spotify

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an application similar to Spotify using their public api. The design of the application will be different but the overall functionalities will still be the same.

This project is educational, giving me room to improve my front-end skills, but also an indication of these skills to other people.

This [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) project uses a few modern technologies such as:

-   [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query)
-   [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
-   [framer-motion](https://github.com/framer/motion)
-   [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
